After the paint has dried on the pot, take it somewhere outside to spray the pots with the lacquer.  I also put some plastic on the inside of the pot, so that the spray doesn't get in there and seep into the soil.  Spray the entire outside of the pot and the top.  Let it sit overnight to make sure that it's completely dry before you put the plant in.",

      "Measure Your Table: This will determine the size and shape of the tablecloth, as well as the amount of fabric yardage required.

Well-made tablecloths are ones where the overhang measurement is the same around the entire perimeter of the table, and hangs just above (and not on) the chair seats.",
      "Prep the Fabric: Making a tablecloth is pretty simple, but it can get more complicated if you need to add panels. A seam down the center can look tacky, so it’s better to add panels to each side of the cloth as shown in the illustration above. The two side panels should be equal length. Try to position the lengthwise seams along the table edges rather than on the surface — this will look more attractive, especially if you’re piecing solid colors of fabric. A patterned fabric makes the seams less noticeable, but you’ll need to match the pattern along the seam lines.",
      "Sew the Tablecloth: For a tablecloth that requires no additional panels to be pieced together, once the fabric is cut to the correct dimensions, you simply have to sew the hem. Options for hemming a tablecloth are endless, and they can impact width and length dimensions. The most common way to hem is to finish the edges with a 1/2 inch double rolled hem.",

Simply pour it into your melted wax and stir for a few seconds. While this step is optional, we definitely recommend it for a lovely floral smell.",
      "Attach the wick: The wick needs to be attached to the bottom of your container before you pour in the wax. You can attach the wick by dipping it in the melting wax then quickly sticking it to the bottom of the container. Let the wax sit five minutes to harden. Alternatively, you can superglue it.",
      "Pour the wax: Before you pour the wax into your container, let it cool for a few minutes. When the temperature on the thermometer reads 140 degrees, it’s time to pour. Then, slowly pour the wax into your container. Hold the wick in place, but don’t pull on it. Leave a small amount of wax in the boiler for topping off your candle later.",
      "Secure the wick: To prevent your wick from swaying in the melty wax, you need to secure it in place. Lay two chopsticks across the top of the container. Sandwich the wick in between so that it stays centered while the wax hardens. Allow the wax to set for four hours at room temperature.",
      "Add more wax: If your candle hardened with an unsightly top (think cracks or holes) simply reheat and add your remaining wax. Let harden.",
      "Cut the wick: Your candle wick should be less than half an inch long. If, when lit, the candle flickers or has a tall flame, trim the wick.",

      "Find your inspiration. Whether you are drawing from a favorite piece that you can not quite afford or looking to add a personal touch to your jewelry box, you want to create a piece that feels like you. And that takes a minute of thought and consideration.",
      "For a playful and contemporary design without the high price tag, you can choose a piece of stone that would work with the colors in your wardrobe and add a complimentary tassel for a fun pop of color.",
      "If you want to incorporate a stone in your design, then the stone choice is important. Choose a stone or crystal that you love. Each type has a different meaning and some have different energies, so follow your heart and intuition.",
      "Using a small bamboo skewer, very carefully apply craft adhesive to the underside of the bead cap. Stick it to the top of your stone and depending on how large the stone is, you may have to bend the edges to conform to its shape. Using a connector ring, loop it through the top of the bead cap and then close the loop on the necklace chain. Make sure you let the glue dry according to the package directions before adding the new charm to your chain.",
      "For the necklace chain, you do not have to buy a chain that comes with clasps attached, but for more novice jewelry makers it might be a smart move. Attaching the clasps is just one more extra step and can be costly to buy the pieces (chain and clasps) separately.",
      "If you plan to add a tassel, you will be shocked by how easy it is and how adorable the finished product looks.",
      "To form your tassel, cut a bunch of strands of embroidery thread the same length. Be sure to cut them a little longer than needed because you can always cut more off, but you will be able to add any back on.",
      "Once you have a nice bunch of string, you will want to fold it in half—the folded ends of the string will form the top of the tassel. Slip a connecting ring through the top end of the tassel and then, using a separate piece of string, tie it around the top to complete the tassel.",
      "Double knot the string so you know it will stay in place. You can then move that string up and down to change the size of the top of the tassel. Trim off any excess string you have on the bottom until you are pleased with the size.",
      "Figure out where the center of the necklace is and where you want the charms to sit based on your neckline and the length of the chain. Using your small pliers—attach via the connecting rings—add your homemade charms to your necklace chain. Be sure that the rings are closed completely so you do not accidentally lose them.",

Once you get the hang of working with wire, you can make all sorts of fun wire jewelry!",

      "Cut 2 pieces of wire: One piece about 1 inch, and another piece about 1.5 -2 inches. I'll be using the shorter piece to make the heart, and the longer piece to make the ring.",

      "Then use your flat nose pliers to make a V bent at the bottom of the heart",
